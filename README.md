# ProgrammingPatternProject
Scenario: 
The project is an application that helps doctors managing their patient appointment and medical records. The application operates in hospitals where doctors need quick access to patient histories, appointment, and treatment plans. The doctors will be able to view, manage and update their patients’ appointments, view patient records and treatment plans.
Design paradigm:
Doctors:
1)	Create appointment.
2)	View appointment.
3)	Reschedule appointment.
4)	Cancel appointment. 
5)	Access medical reports.
6)	Create new medical reports.
7)	Create treatment plans
8)	View treatment plans (diagnosis, treatment and price)
9)	View who are their patients and their information.
10)	The application can be switched between French and English.
Patients:
1)	Create appointment.
2)	View appointment.
3)	Reschedule appointment.
4)	Cancel appointment. 
5)	Access medical reports
6)	View treatment plans
7)	The application can be switched between French and English.
8)	Can view their doctors

Expected output:
A window will ask you to sign in, after you sign in as a doctor you click on the appointment button that gives you option to view your patients’ appointments or modify them. You also have a button for patients records where you can view either all of them at once or filter them by checking the options that you want e.g.: only the patients that have a specific diagnosis that you specify can be selected as well as their information or if the patients have more than three appointments they will be selected. There is also a button where you can create new medical record for a patient. 
If you sign in as a patient, you click on the appointment button that gives you option to view all your appointments or modify them. You also have a button to view your medical records where you can view either all of them at once or filter them by checking the options that you want e.g.: view only the medical records that was done by a specified doctor. There is also a button to check your bills.
